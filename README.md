# FUNSD-Information-Extraction

Forms are a widespread type of document used in lots of fields. They are an appropriate way to collect and communicate data. The demand in digitising forms and interpreting data is enormous.

In this repository we have focused on the task of **form understanding** from scanned documents. It can be defined as the process of automatically extracting information from a form, and it is usually approached by analysing both *textual contents* and *organisational structures*. This task remains a challenging task due to the diversity of
templates, structures, layouts, and formats that can greatly vary from one form to another.

The scarcity of works in this area is mainly based on the absence of datasets of forms due to the sensitive information included in these documents. Therefore,in 2019, FUNSD dataset was released. This is a dataset with 199 fully annotated images.

We will combine **computer vision** and **natural language processing** techniques. The computer vision techniques will take care of the detection task and the natural language processing techniques will take care of the text classification
